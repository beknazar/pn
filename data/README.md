# PubNative Data Science test case

The purpose of this challenge is to check your machine learning knowledge and engineering skills.

You are given a training and validation dataset. It is a simple binary classification problem, where the target variable is `classLabel`. Your goal is to:

1. Create and train a machine learning model using the training set that performs well on the validation set.
You should decide on the KPI of "performance" yourself but remember the choice will also be assessed as part of the test.

2. Bonus points if you can design and create a microservice that will serve predictions of that model.

3. Mega bonus points if you manage to build it so that it learns online (meaning it accepts labled data one by one and gradually improves the predictions) using the given dataset as initial "starter".

You are free to use any of the following languages:
[Go, Scala, Java, Python, R].
We would be happy to follow the process that you use when approaching such task, so a small writeup of the observations/thoughts on top of the source code will be greatly appreciated.

Good luck!ðŸ‘¾
